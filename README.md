# ePhone - iframe a site onto a phone model

Built with `@react-three/fiber`.

In the future, I want to make this a more involved 3D environment built around an iframe, but satisfied for a very quick hack and my first dabble with Three.js.

Shout out Sam Osborne for the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQRqU3N3ehs). As of initial spike, the only additive things I had to do were figure out the positioning values for the model I wanted to use and add occlusion.
